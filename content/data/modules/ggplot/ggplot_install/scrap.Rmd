In data analysis it's super important to look at your data early and often. For that we use a new package called  __ggplot2__! 
<br><br>

Install it by running the following in your _Console_:

- `install.packages("ggplot2")`

<br><br>

<div class="note">
### Note {-}

You can also install packages from the `Packages` tab in the lower right window of RStudio.

## A column plot {-}
Here's a simple chart showing the total amount of scrap sold from each origin location.

```{r, warning=F}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r, fig.width=12}
ggplot(scrap, aes(y = amount, x = origin)) + 
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Which origin sold the most scrap?") + 
  theme_gray()

```

Well, well, well, it looks like there is an **All** category we should look into more. Either there is a town hogging all the scrap or the data needs some cleaning.

### <i class="fa fa-user-astronaut" aria-hidden="true" style="color: green"></i> Explore! {-}

Try changing `theme_gray()` to `theme_dark()`. What changes on the chart? What stays the same?

Try another theme: `theme_classic()` or `theme_void()` or delete the entire line and the `+` above to see what the default settings are.

You can view all available theme options at [ggplot2 themes](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html).
