# Where am I? 
<hr>

When you open a new R project in RStudio your working directory is your project folder. Your project folder is like your home planet, and is the default location R will look for data files. To load a file called `new_data.csv` in your project folder, all you need to do is:

```{r, eval = F}

df <- read_csv("new_data.csv")
```


__But what if the data is located in a different folder?__ 

If you remember land lines, your phone automatically assumes the default Area Code when you dial a number. And when you want to call another Area Code, you have to dial it in. Similarly, you have to tell R to go look in another folder to access files outside of your home directory. 

### Example 1

To load a file called `Ewok_data.csv` located in the folder `Endor` inside your project folder, you would type:

```{r, eval = F}

df <- read_csv("Endor/Ewok_data.csv")
```


__NOTE:__ The slash used for file paths in R is a forward leaning slash (`/`), and is the opposite of the slash commonly seen in folder locations on _Windows_ computers. If you get an __\*ERROR\*__, remember to check your slash.


### Example 2

If a file is completely outside of your project, you'll want to include the entire file path. An entire file path usually begins with the letter of the computer drive, such as `C:/` or `X:/`. Loading a file called `secret_data.csv` directly from your Desktop would look something like this:

```{r, eval=F}

df <- read_csv("C:/Users/me/Desktop/secret_data.csv")
```
