> To get Rey's ship working we need to track down more of the scrap item: __`Ion engine`__. 

__Step 1:__

- __filter__ the data to only `Ion engine`

<br>

<details>
<summary class = "btn_code_blue">_Show code_</summary>
<p>
```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# Grab only the items named "Ion engine"
scrap_pounds <- filter(scrap_pounds, item == "Ion engine")
```
</p>
</details>

<br><br>
<hr class="hr2">

Next _arrange_ the data in descending order of pounds so Rey knows where the highest amount of `Ion engine` scrap comes from. 

__Step 2:__

- __arrange__ in descending order by `amount_lbs`

<br>

<details>
<summary class="btn_code_blue"> _Show code_ </summary>
<p>
```{r arrange-final, eval=F, message=F, warning=F}
# Arrange data
scrap_pounds <- arrange(scrap_pounds, desc(amount_lbs))

# Return the origin of the highest amount_lbs of scrap
head(scrap_pounds, 1)

# Plot the total amount_lbs by origin
ggplot(scrap_pounds, aes(x = origin, y = amount_lbs)) + 
  geom_col()
```
</p>
</details>

<div class="quiz">
### Complete the mission! {-}

__For the item `Ion engine`, which origin has the most `amount_lbs`?__

## First mission complete! {-}
__Nice work!__ Rey got a great deal on her engines and even traded in some scrap for spending cash. _You've got the music in you, oh, oh, oh... Sorry._
