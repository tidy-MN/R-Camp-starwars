Guess what else comes with the `dplyr` package?

- A **Star Wars data set**.

#### Open the data {-}

1. Load the `dplyr` package from your `library()`
1. Pull the Star Wars dataset into your environment.
    
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

people <- starwars
```

### <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Rules </span> {-}

1. __You have a _top secret_ identity.__
1. Scroll through the Star Wars dataset and find a character you find interesting.
    - _Or run `sample_n(starwars_data, 1)` to choose one at random._
1. __Keep it hidden!__ Don't show your neighbor the character you chose.
1. Take turns asking each other questions about your partner's Star Wars character. 
1. Use the answers to build a `filter()` function and narrow down the potential characters your neighbor may have picked. 


For example: Here's a `filter()` statement that filters the data to the character _Plo Koon_.

<div style="width: 90%; margin-left: 8%">
```{r, eval=F}
mr_koon <- filter(people,
                  mass       < 100,
                  eye_color  != "blue",
                  sex        == "male",
                  homeworld  == "Dorin",
                  birth_year > 20)

```
</div>


### My character has __NO__ hair! _(Missing values)_ {-}

Sometimes a character will be missing a specific attribute. We learned earlier how R stores missing values as `NA`. If your character has a missing value for hair color, one of your filter statements would be ` is.na(hair_color) `. 

What if you know the value is NOT `NA`? To add that to your filter you add an `!` (exclamation point) in front of `is.na()`. In R the `!` signifies NOT or the opposite of what comes after.

So:

- `!=` translates to "is NOT equal to"
- `!is.na()` translates to "is NOT NA"
