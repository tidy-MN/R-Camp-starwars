## The `ggplot()` sandwich {-}

<h5 style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -42px;"> A `ggplot` has 3 ingredients. </h5>


## 1. The base plot {-}
```{r, echo = T, eval = T}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r, echo=T, eval=T}
ggplot(scrap)
```

<br>

> We load version 2 of the package `library(ggplot2)`, but the function to make the plot is plain `ggplot()`. _Sorry, ggplot is fun that like that._ 


## 2. The the X, Y _aesthetics_  {-}

The _aesthetics_ assign the columns from the data that you want to use in the chart. This is where you set the `X`-`Y` variables that determine the dimensions of the plot.

```{r, eval = T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = destination, 
                  y = amount)) 
```


## 3. The layers AKA geometries  {-}
```{r, eval = T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = destination, 
                  y = amount)) + 
  geom_col()
```


## Colors {-}
<hr class="hrlvl2">

Now let's change the fill color to match the destination.
```{r, eval=T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = destination, 
                  y = amount, 
                  fill = destination)) +
  geom_col() 
```

<br>

## Sorting and labels{-}
<hr class="hrlvl2">

Finally, let's order the amounts from highest to lowest *(decreasing)*.
```{r, eval=T}
ggplot(scrap, aes(x = reorder(destination, amount, decreasing = TRUE), 
                  y = amount, 
                  fill = destination)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "The Trade Caravan receives the most scrap",
       subtitle = "Total scrap shipments on planet Jakku",
       x = "destination",
       caption = "Source: Data intercepted by BB8 in year 2023")
```
