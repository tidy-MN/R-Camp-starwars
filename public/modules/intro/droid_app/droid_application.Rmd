```{r}
# Your droid bio
intro <- "**Hello!**  I am a classically trained data scientist living on planet Endor. 
  Wherever I go I bring a supply of good energy. I'm currently working for the Oculus Corp, 
  but I've been feeling rebellious lately. I love talking about urban forests and discussing 
  true crime podcasts."
```
