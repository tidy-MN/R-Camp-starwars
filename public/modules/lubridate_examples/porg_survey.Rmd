### The Ewoks need our help. There's porgs **EVERYWHERE!** {-}

<img src="../images/porgs_bb8_2.jpg" style="margin-top: 0px;">


Porgs have been spreading across the galaxy, likely hitching rides on unsuspecting ships. They're so cute people hate to say it, but they are starting to become a nuisance in some place. 

To get a grasp on the problem the Ewoks are doing the first ever porg survey. And they need your help planning the **survey**.


# <i class="fa fa-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></i> Dates with `lubridate`

### The `lubridate` package. {-}

![](../images/lubridate.png){style="width: 21%; float: left; margin-right: 30px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 12px;"}

<br>

It's about time! Lubridate makes working with dates much easier.

We can find how much time has elapsed, add or subtract days, and find seasonal and day of the week averages.

<br>

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

### Install `lubridate` {-}
```{r, eval=F}

### Survey objective {-}

<div class="well">

- The Ewoks have asked you help organize their Porg survey.
- In 2023, they would like to perform a porg count once a week from May to October.
- They have enough volunteers to run the survey at two locations
    - `Bright Tree` and `Fern Gully`
    
</div>

<br>

Let's generate the full list of dates during this time span using the sequence date function: ` seq.Date()`

#### Run the code below to create a date for every possible day of the survey. {-}
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(lubridate)

start_date <- ymd("2023-05-01")

end_date   <- ymd("2023-10-31")

# Sequence from start to end, counting by 1 day intervals
survey_dates <- seq.Date(from = start_date, 
                         to = end_date, 
                         by = "day")
```

<br>

### How many days will the survey run? {-}


<details>
<summary class = "btn_code">Show answer</summary>
  
> *184 days*

</details>

<br>

### Let's put the dates in a dataframe {-}

> Remember how to make a dataframe?


### Here's a reminder {-}
```{r}
survey <- data.frame(count_date = survey_dates)

head(survey)
```


### Yes! {-}


## 1. Scheduling weekdays {-}

<img src="https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-128/calendar-1562-518053.png" align=right />

Ewoks are very busy. They only have one day per week when they can volunteer. 

Here is the weekday when volunteers are available at each location:

- Bright Tree: ` Thursdays`
- Fern Gully: ` Fridays`

<br>

We can use the `seq.Date()` function and the option to step `by = "week"` to
generate the survey dates for each site. But we need to know which day to start from.


> #### When is the first Thursday in May of 2023? {-}


<br>

For that, we can use the `wday()`, the "weekday" function.

```{r, eval=T}
# wday tells you the day of week (Sun, Mon, etc..) for a specific date
wday(ymd('2023-05-01'), label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)
```

<br>

So the `1st` of May will be a Monday. 
That means.... **May the 4th** will be a Thursday. Perfect! That's my favorite day.


## Mutate to the rescue {-}

We really don't want to check every date one by one do we? 

Let's add a new `week_day` column to our survey table that checks ALL the dates ALL at once. To add a new column we call our friend `mutate()`.


Complete the code below to add a `week_day` column.
```{r, eval=F}

survey <- mutate(survey, 
                 week_day = wday( ________ , label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE))
```


```{r, eval=T, echo=F}
library(knitr)

survey <- mutate(survey, 
                 week_day = wday(count_date, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE))
```

<br>

## `filter()` week days {-}

With **filter** we can pick out only the days of the week that we want. 

Split the schedule in two by filtering the survey to only the week day needed at each site: 

- ` Thursday` for Bright Tree
- ` Friday` for Fern Gully

<br>

```{r, eval=F}
bright_dates <- filter(survey, week_day ==  ________ )

fern_dates   <- filter(survey, week_day ==  ________ )
```

<details>
<summary  class = "btn_code">Show code</summary>
  
```{r, eval=T, echo=T}
bright_dates <- filter(survey, week_day ==  "Thursday" )

fern_dates   <- filter(survey, week_day ==  "Friday" )
```

</details>


<br>


**How many survey dates are at each site?**

> *Hint: It's less than 50.*


<details>
<summary  class = "btn_code">Show answer</summary>
  
> **26 survey days**

</details>

<br>


## 2. Particular date formats {-}

<img align="left" src="../images/dwight.png" style="margin-right: 14px;">

Oh no! Each survey site has a very-very particular **Assistant to the Regional Manager**. And they are demanding a very **specific** date format for their work schedules. 

<br>

Before you send off the survey dates, you'll need to adjust the dates to match the requested formats below. 

**Preferred date formats**

- Bright Tree: ` 5-11-2023`
- Fern Gully: ` May 12, 2023`

<br>

Use `format(count_date, ...)` and the date expressions below to format the schedule for each region accordingly. 

> For example: `format(count_date, "%b, %Y")` prints the date as `Aug, 2023`.
> 
> - `%b`  stands for 3-letter month abbreviation 
> - `%Y%` stands for the full 4 digit year


### Date parts {-}

| Expression    | Description                       | Example  |
| :------------ | :-------------------------------- | :------- |
| `%Y`          | Year (4 digit)                    | 2023     |
| `%y`          | Year (2 digit)                    | 21       |
| `%B`          | Month (full name)                 | December |
| `%b`          | Month (abbreviated)               | Dec      |
| `%m`          | Month (decimal number)            | 12       |
| `%d`          | Day of the month (decimal number) | 30       |


### Time parts {-}

| Expression    | Description                       | Example  |
| :------------ | :-------------------------------- | :------- |
| `%H`          | Hour                              | 8        |
| `%M`          | Minute                            | 13       |
| `%S`          | Second                            | 35       |


<br>

Use `mutate()` to update the **week_day** column in both site schedules.

**Here's a start**

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
# Set date format to 5-11-2023
bright_dates <- mutate(bright_dates, count_date = format(count_date, _______  ))

# Set date format to May 12, 2023
fern_dates <- mutate(fern_dates, count_date = format(count_date, _______ ))
```


<details>
<summary  class = "btn_code">Show code</summary>
  
```{r, eval=T, echo=T}
# Set date format to 5-11-2023
bright_dates <- mutate(bright_dates, count_date = format(count_date, "%m-%d-%Y"))

# Set date format to May 12, 2023
fern_dates <- mutate(fern_dates, count_date = format(count_date, "%b %d, %Y"))
```

</details>

### How'd we do? {-}

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
# Bright Tree schedule
head(bright_dates, 3)
```

```{r, eval=T, echo=F}
head(bright_dates, 3) %>% kable()
```

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
# Fern Gully schedule
head(fern_dates, 3)
```

```{r, eval=T, echo=F}
head(fern_dates, 3) %>% kable()
```


<br>

**Congrats\!**

Your fine-tuned schedules worked perfectly. 

Now let’s jump ahead and take a look at the survey results.

<br>


## 3. Results {-}

![](../images/porgs_lifecycle.jpg){width=80%}


### Load the porg survey results. {-}

```{r, eval=F}
porgs <- read_csv("https://mn-r.netlify.app/data/2022_porg_survey_results.csv")   
```

```{r, eval=T, echo=F}
porgs <- read_csv("../../../content/data/2022_porg_survey_results.csv")   
```


<br>

*Explore a bit.* 

> Are there missing values?

<br>

### A missing site {-}

It looks like we have a slight missing data problem.

There’s a data point in the results that wasn’t labeled with the site
location. We do know the date however. 

On `2023-06-30` there were a whopping 7 porgs counted - but we just don’t know where.

<br>

**Can you determine the site based on the date of the porg count?**

```{r}
mystery_site_date <- "2023-06-30"
```

> *Hint: What weekday is this?*
>
> Try the `wday(date)` function.

<br>


**Good sleuthing data droid.**

We'll learn how to update the site value later today, but right now we're in a hurry, so let's remove the row using filter.

Use `filter()` to keep only the rows in the porgs data where `site` is **NOT** *NA* (missing).

```{r, eval=T}
porgs <- filter(porgs, !is.na(site))  
```

<br>


## 4. The best time for porgs {-}

> ### What is the best month to see porgs? {-}

**First, add a `month` column to the data with the function `month()` and the column `count_date`.**

```{r, eval=T}
porgs <- porgs %>%
         mutate(month = month(count_date))
```

<br>

**Next, use `ggplot()` and `geom_col()` to plot the porg sightings by month.**

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(porgs, aes(x = month, y = ______ , fill = site)) +
    geom_col()
```

<details>
<summary  class = "btn_code">Show code</summary>
  
```{r, eval=T, echo=T}
ggplot(porgs, aes(x = month, y = porg_count, fill = site)) +
    geom_col()
```

</details>

<br>

> Why might June be the lowest month?
>
> *Hint:* Fern Gully


## 5. Time series - All the data {-}

Plot all the data with `geom_point()`. Put `count_date` on the x-axis, and the `porg_count` on the y-axis. Set the color to match the `site` column.

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(porgs, aes(x = _______, y = ______ , color = _____ )) +
    geom_point(size = 5)
```

<details>
<summary  class = "btn_code">Show code</summary>
  
```{r, eval=T, echo=T}
ggplot(porgs, aes(x = count_date, y = porg_count, color = site)) +
    geom_point(size = 5) 
```

</details>


<br>

Oof! That's a busy plot. Try adding `+ facet_wrap("site")` to the end. 
What happens?

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(porgs, aes(x = count_date, y = porg_count, color = site)) +
  geom_point(size = 5) +
  facet_wrap("site")   #<<
```

<br>

Try adding `+ geom_line()`. 

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(porgs, aes(x = count_date, y = porg_count, color = site)) +
  geom_point(size = 5) +
  facet_wrap(~ site) +
  geom_line()                #<<
```


<br>
