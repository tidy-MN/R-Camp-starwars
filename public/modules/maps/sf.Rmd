## But wait... {-}
<hr class="hrlvl2">

The Ewoks say it's unsafe to land. Booo... Sounds like the Empire is checking all ships for licenses. 

Lucky for us there is some good news. They say for a small ship like ours, it is possible to land undetected. But we'll have to put down right-dab in the middle of the 3 northern outposts. 

<br>

> Are you up for a challenge data droid?

<br>

Either way, let's make a map to see what we're up against. To help, our comrades sent along the coordinates of the Empire's outposts. Guess what the first step is? That's right. Time to add a new package. 


# <i class="fas fa-globe-africa"></i> Maps with `sf`
<hr>

### The `sf` package. {-}

![](../images/sf.gif){style="width: 21%; float: left; margin-right: 30px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 12px;"}


<br>

SF makes maps and spatial analysis in R feel like you're working with regular table data. It's full of spatial functions for calculating distances and areas, adding buffers around points, and all the handy dplyr toolbox functions will work as well.


Let's get it!


<div style="clear: both;"></div>


### Install `sf` {-}

```{r, eval=F}  
install.packages("sf")
```

<br>

```{r, eval=T, echo=F}
library(sf)
library(dplyr)

# Create coordinates
outposts <- tibble(ID = c("1NO","1NL","3NB"),
                   lat = c(36.6552, 36.583748, 36.5979), 
                   long = c(-118.8469, -118.8195, -118.90218))

outposts <- st_as_sf(outposts, coords = c("long", "lat"), crs = 4326)

outposts <- st_transform(outposts, 26915)

outposts$y_utm <- st_coordinates(outposts)[,2]
outposts$x_utm <- st_coordinates(outposts)[,1]

#outposts$crs <- "UTM Zone 15N; EPSG: 26915"

outposts <- select(outposts, ID, x_utm, y_utm, everything())

#st_write(outposts, "../../../content/data/endor_outposts.shp")
```



## Reading coordinates {-}
To read coordinates stored in a spreadsheet or CSV, we can read them into R with our usual friends `read_csv()` and `read_excel()`.

**Like this:**
```{r, eval=F} 
library(readr)

outposts <- read_csv("endor_outposts.csv")

# or
library(readxl)

outposts <- read_excel("endor_outposts.xlsx")
```


<br>

### However {-}

Unfortunately, Endor still uses ancient data systems and their spatial data is in a format known as "shapefiles". But don't worry, we can do it all with `st_read()`. 

It's a real gem. 


### Get the shapefile {-}

1. Download the data.
    - <a href="https://github.com/MPCA-data/R-Camp/raw/main/public/data/endor_outposts.zip"><span class="btn_code_blue" style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 12px;"> __DOWNLOAD __  </span></a> -  Get the Endor outpost coordinates
1. Create a new folder called `data` in your project folder.
1. Move the downloaded `endor_outposts.zip` file into the folder.
1. Right click on the file > Select `Extract All...` >> Click `Extract`.
1. You're ready for `st_read()`.



## Give it a try {-}
```{r, eval=F} 
library(sf)
library(dplyr)

outposts <- st_read("data/endor_outposts/endor_outposts.shp")
```


<br>

### Take a look {-}
```{r, eval=T} 
outposts

glimpse(outposts)

st_coordinates(outposts)
```


<br>

To make a quick map, use ggplot and add `+ geom_sf()`. 
```{r, eval=T, fig.width=10, fig.height=4} 
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(outposts) + 
  geom_sf(size = 8, color = "steelblue") 
```

<br>

**Try running the function `st_distance()` on your outposts.** 

> What do you get?

<br>


## Where's the center point? {-}


### The `st_centroid()` function will find it! {-}

```{r, eval=T}
# First- Combine all outposts into one object
outposts_combined <- st_combine(outposts) 

# Then - get the objects center              
land_pad <- st_centroid(outposts_combined)
```

```{r, eval=F}
# View center coordinates
land_pad
```

```{r, echo=F}
kable(land_pad)
```

<br>


### We found it! {-}

That's fantastic. 

But there's one more piece of bad news... These coordintes are in a different Coordinate Reference System (CRS) than our ship needs. CRS is a real thing!

The Endor outposts are currently in the UTM coordinate system, but our ship requires coordinates in **WGS84 Lat/Lng**. These coordinates generally look like this `(45.6, -93.12)`. See https://epsg.io/4326 for more details.


The **SF** package will help with coordinate conversions as well. Try using `st_transform()` and set the crs argument to: `crs = 4326`. 


```{r, eval=T}
# Transform outposts
outposts <- st_transform(outposts, crs = 4326)

# Transform landing pad
land_pad <- st_transform(land_pad, crs = 4326)
```


### Wonderful!{-}

<br>

<div class="note">
<h3> <i class="fas fa-heart" aria-hidden="true" style="color: hotpink"></i>  Minnesota </h3>

In Minnesota, you'll often receive coordinates with the CRS set to *UTM Zone 15N*. This is CRS number `26915`. See https://epsg.io/26915.

</div>


<br>

<div class="well">
We're going to need to be very precise to land perfectly in between these outposts. To make our captain really happy, let's put this all in an interactive zoomable map. For interactive maps we use **leaflet**.

</div>

##Leaflet maps 
<hr>

### The `leaflet` package. {-}

![](../images/leaflet.png){style="width: 37%; float: left; margin-right: 30px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 12px;"}


Leaflet makes interactive maps easy and you build them up in layers similar to a ggplot.

<br>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>


### Install `leaflet` {-}
```{r, eval=F}  
install.packages("leaflet")
```


## Maps that zoom {-}

Leaflet builds map with layers similar to ggplot, but instead of adding things with the `+`, leaflet adds new layers with the `%>%` ("the pipe").

### 1. Start with the outpost coordinates {-}
```{r, eval=T, fig.height=4, fig.width=9} 
library(leaflet)

leaflet(outposts) %>% 
  addCircles(radius = 250) %>%  
  addTiles()
```

<br>


### 2. Add the landing site {-}

*Fingers crossed it's in the middle....*

```{r, eval=F, fig.height=4, fig.width=9}  
leaflet(outposts) %>% 
  addCircles(radius = 300) %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(data  = land_pad)  #<<
```

<br>


### 3. Add labels {-}

*Try hovering over one of the outposts to see its label.*

```{r, eval=T, fig.height=4, fig.width=9} 
leaflet(outposts) %>% 
  addCircles(radius = 300,
             label = ~ID) %>%   #<<
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(data  = land_pad,
             label = "Land HERE!",  #<<
             labelOptions = labelOptions(noHide = T))  #<<
```


<br>


<div class="tip">

### <i class="fa fa-user-astronaut" aria-hidden="true" style="color: green"></i> Explore! {-}

News just came in that the outposts will soon be upgrading their **radar** to detect ships up to `4,200 meters` away. Will that be a problem? 

**Steps**

1. Use `st_buffer()` to add a 4,200 meter ring around each outpost. 
    - `outposts_new <- st_buffer(outposts, dist = 4200)` 
1. Then add a layer to the leaflet map using `addPolygons()` with `data = outposts_new`. 
1. You can drop the `radius = 300` argument. 

<details>
<summary class = "btn_code">_Show code_</summary>

```{r, eval=F}
outposts_new <- st_buffer(outposts, dist = 4200)

leaflet(outposts) %>%
  addCircles(label = ~ID) %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(data  = land_pad,
             label = "Land HERE???",  
             labelOptions = labelOptions(noHide = T)) %>%
  addPolygons(data = outposts_new,    #<<
              fillColor = "yellow")   #<<
```

**Wow!** 

You're on fire data droid. Let's sit here a minute and cool down...  

Ok, now let's get down on that planet before we get stuck with permanent space legs up here.
