When you close R for the first time you'll see some options about saving your workspace, history, and other files. In general, we advise against saving these files. This will help RStudio open a fresh and clean environment every time you start it. It's easy enough to re-run your script next time you open your project.

Follow these steps to set these options permanently, and not see the pop-up windows when you close R.

__Turn off *Save Workspace* __

1. Go to ` Tools > Global Options.... `  on the top RStudio navigation bar
1. On the first screen:
    - Under **Workspace**
        - [ ] &nbsp; Uncheck _Restore .Rdata into workspace at startup_
        - Set _Save workspace to .RData on exit_ to **[Never]**
    - Under **History**
        - [ ] &nbsp; Uncheck _Always save history_
1. Click `OK` at the bottom
