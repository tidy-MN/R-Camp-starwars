## A scrappy ransom {-}

Mr. Baddy Plutt is demanding __10,000 items__ of scrap for Finn. Sounds expensive, but lucky for us he didn't clarify the exact items. Let's find the scrap that weighs the least per shipment and try to make this transaction as light as possible.

<div class="tip"> 
<h3 style="margin-top: 13px;"> Update from BB8! </h3>

BB8 was busy on our flight back to Jakku, and recovered a __full__ set of scrap records from the notorious Unkar Plutt. Let's take a look.

```{r full-scrap}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

# Read in the full scrap database
scrap <- read_csv("https://mn-r.netlify.app/data/starwars_scrap_jakku_full.csv")
```
</div>

<br>

Take a look at the __NEW__ scrap data and see if we have the weight of all the items.

```{r fullscrap-units}
# What unit types are in the data?
unique(scrap$units)
```

<br>

__Or return results as a data frame__
```{r distinct-units}
distinct(scrap, units)
```

<br>

_Hmmm...._ So how much does a cubic yard of `Hull Panel` weigh? 

_A lot? 32? Maybe..._ 

I think we're going to need some more data.

<div class="tip">
__"Hey BB8!"__ 

__"Do your magic data finding thing."__
</div>


## Weight conversion {-}

It took a while, but with a few droid bribes BB8 was able to track down a _Weight conversion table_ from his droid buddies. Our current data shows the total cubic yards for some scrap shipments, but not how much the shipment weighs. 


### Read the weight conversion table {-}
```{r read-convert}
# The data's URL
convert_url <- "https://mn-r.netlify.app/data/conversion_table.csv"

# Read the conversion data
convert <- read_csv(convert_url)

head(convert, 3)
```

<br>

Oh my stars! A cubic yard of `Hull Panel` weighs __641 lbs__. I knew it!

Let's join this new conversion table to the scrap data to make our calculations easier. To do that we need to meet a new function.

__Say Hello to our friend `left_join()`!__
