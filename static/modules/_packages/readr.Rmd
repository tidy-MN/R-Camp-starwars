> __What is an _R package_?__

A _package_ is a small add-on for R, it's like a phone App for your phone. 
They add capabilities like statistical functions, mapping powers, and special charts to R. In order to use a new package we first need to install it. Let's try it!

The _readr_ package helps import data into R in different formats. 
It helps you out by cleaning the data of extra white space and formatting tricky date formats automatically.

__Add a package to your library__  

1. Open _RStudio_ 
1. Type ` install.packages("readr") ` in the lower left console
1. Press Enter
1. _Wait two seconds_
1. Open the `Packages` tab in the lower right window of RStudio to see the packages in your _library_
    - Use the search bar to find the `readr` package

<br>

Your installed packages are stored in your R _library_. The `Packages` tab on the right shows all of the available packages installed in your library. When you want to use one of them, you load it in R. 

Loading a package is like opening an App on your phone. To load a package we use the `library()` function.
Once you load it, the package will stay loaded until you close RStudio.
