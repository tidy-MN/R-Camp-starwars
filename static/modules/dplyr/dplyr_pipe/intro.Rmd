### You can with the *pipe*! {-}

Use the `%>%` to chain functions together and make our scripts more streamlined.

<div style="clear: both;"></div>



## The `%>%` helps: {-}

### __`#1:`__ Eliminate nested parentheses {-}

Let's say you have 3 numbers. Your analysis requires that you take the sum of them, then take the log of that result, and then round the final outcome. 

### Without the pipe <i class="fas fa-frown"></i> {-}
```{r maths, eval=F}
round(log(sum(c(10, 20, 30, 50))))
```

<br>

The code above is dense and we need to read it backwards from right to left to understand the order of operations. The pipe on the other hand allows us to read the code from left to right.

### With the pipe <i class="fas fa-smile"></i> {-}
```{r maths_better, eval = F}
result <- c(10, 20, 30, 50) %>%
            sum() %>%
            log() %>%
            round()
```

### __`#2:`__ Combine processing steps into one cohesive chunk {-}


### Without the pipe {-}
```{r review, eval=F}
scrap <- arrange(scrap, desc(price_per_pound))

scrap <- filter(scrap, origin != "All")

scrap <- mutate(scrap, 
                scrap_finder    = "BB8",
                measure_method  = "REM-24")
```


### With the pipe {-}
```{r review-better, eval=F}

scrap <- scrap %>%
           arrange(desc(price_per_pound)) %>%
           filter(origin != "All") %>%
           mutate(scrap_finder    = "BB8",
                  measure_method  = "REM-24")

```

<div class="tip">
### <i class="fa fa-user-astronaut" style="color: green;"></i> Explore! {-}

Similar to above, use the `%>%` to combine the 3 analysis lines below.

```{r pipe-test, eval=F}
# Group the scrap data by item
scrap <- group_by(scrap, item)

# Calculate each item's mean price 
scrap <- summarize(scrap, mean_price = mean(price_per_unit))

# Ungroup the data
scrap <- ungroup(scrap)
```
</div>


## Let the `%>%` guide you. {-}
