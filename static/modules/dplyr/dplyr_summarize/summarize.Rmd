`summarize()` uses summary functions `mean()` or `sum()` to collapse the data down to a single summary row. To get started we'll need some summary functions like `sum()`, `mean()`, `min()`, and `max()`.


## `sum()` {-}

Use `summarize()` and `sum()` to find the total credits of all the scrap combined.

```{r, eval = F}
summarize(scrap, total_credits = sum(credits))
```


## `mean()` {-}
Use `summarize()` and `mean()` to calculate the _mean_ `price_per_pound` in the scrap report.

```{r, eval = F}

summarize(scrap, mean_price = mean(price_per_pound, na.rm = T))

```

### Note {-}

__What's the average of missing data?__ I don't know.

Did you see the `na.rm = TRUE` inside the `mean()` function. This tells R to ignore empty cells or missing values that show up in R as `NA`. If you leave `na.rm` out, the _mean_ function will return 'NA' if it finds a missing value anywhere in the data. 
</div>

## `median()` {-}
Use summarize to calculate the _median_ price_per_pound in the scrap report.

`summarize(scrap, median_price = median(price_per_pound, na.rm = T))`

## `max()` {-}
Use summarize to calculate the _maximum_ price per pound any scrapper got for their scrap.

`summarize(scrap, max_price = max(price_per_pound, na.rm = T))`

## `min()` {-}
Use summarize to calculate the _minimum_ price per pound any scrapper got for their scrap.

`summarize(scrap, min_price = min(price_per_pound, na.rm = T))`


## `sd()` {-}

What is the _standard deviation_ of the credits?

`summarize(scrap, stdev_credits = sd(credits))`

## `quantile()` {-}

_Quantiles_ are useful for finding the upper or lower range of a column. Use the `quantile()` function to find the the 5th and 95th quantile of the prices.

```{r quants, eval = FALSE}
summarize(scrap, 
          price_5th_pctile  = quantile(price_per_pound, 0.05, na.rm = T),
          price_95th_pctile = quantile(price_per_pound, 0.95))
```


__Hint:__ Add `na.rm = T` to `quantile()`.


## `n()` {-}

`n()` stands for _count_.

Use summarize and `n()` to count the number of scrap records. 

```{r, eval=F}
summarize(scrap, scrap_records = n())
```

1. Create a summary of the scrap data that includes 3 of the summary functions above. The following is one example.

```{r, eval = F}
scrap_summary <- summarize(scrap, 
                           max_credits      = __________,
                           weight_90th_pct  = quantile(Weight, 0.90),
                           count_records    = __________,
                    
```

<br>

<br>


2. Use summarize and `n()` to count the number of reported scrap records going to `Niima outpost`. 

__Hint:__ Use `filter()` first.


```{r, eval=F}
niima_scrap <- filter(scrap, destination == "Niima Outpost") 

niima_scrap <- summarize(niima_scrap, scrap_records = n())
```


</div>
