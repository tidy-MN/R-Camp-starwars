You've made some plots you can be proud of, so let's learn to save them so we can cherish them forever. There's a function called `ggsave` to do just that. 

So how do we `ggsave` our plots? 

__Let's try `help(ggsave)` or `?ggsave`.__

```{r ggsave, eval = F, echo = T}
# Get help
help(ggsave)
?ggsave

# Run the R code for your favorite plot first
ggplot(data, aes()) +
   .... +
   ....

# Then save your plot to a png file of your choosing
ggsave("results/plot_name.png")
```
