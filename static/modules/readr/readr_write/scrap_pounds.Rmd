You can't break your original dataset if you name your edited data something new. Let's use the `readr` package to save our new CSV with the tons converted to pounds.

```{r write-csv1, eval=F}
# Save data as a CSV file 
write_csv(scrap_pounds, "scrap_in_pounds.csv")
```

Let's create a new `results/` folder to keep our processed data separate from any raw data we receive. Now we can add `results/` to our file path in `write_csv()` to tell R to put the file in that folder.

```{r write-csv2, eval=F}
# Save data as a CSV file to results folder
write_csv(scrap_pounds, "results/scrap_in_pounds.csv")
```
